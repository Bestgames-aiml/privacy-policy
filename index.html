        <li><strong>Store and/or access information on a device (on the basis of your consent)</strong> - Cookies, device or similar online identifiers (e.g. login-based identifiers, randomly assigned identifiers, network-based identifiers) together with other information (e.g. browser type and information, language, screen size, supported technologies, etc.) can be stored or read on your device to recognise it each time it connects to an app or to a website for one or several of the purposes presented here.</li>
        <li><strong>Use limited data to select advertising (on the basis of your consent)</strong> - Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on limited data such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type, or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times an ad is presented to you).</li>
        <li><strong>Create profiles for personalised advertising (on the basis of your consent)</strong> - Information about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit, content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and other websites or apps) or similar users.

        <li><strong>Measure advertising performance (on the basis of your consent)</strong> - Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached.
